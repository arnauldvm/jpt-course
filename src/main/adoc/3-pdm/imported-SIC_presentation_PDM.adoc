Dominant Consumer: JVM
----------------------

[width="{pdm-width}", halign="center", float="right"]
|===========
| Actors
| Application
| *Java VM*
| OS (Hardware)
|===========

Usual causes::
* Memory management
** memory leaks, System.gc(), premature promotion, memory pools sizing
* (JIT tuning usually not necessary, except when extreme speed is needed)

Examine GC log.

IMPORTANT: *Symptom* +
GC CPU ratio too high (too many GC events, too much time in GC...)


Dominant Consumer: Application
------------------------------

[width="{pdm-width}", halign="center", float="right"]
|===========
| Actors
| *Application*
| Java VM
| OS (Hardware)
|===========

Usual causes::
* Wrong algorithm
* Unnecessary work
* ...

Execution profiling.

IMPORTANT: *Symptoms* +
- High CPU and no abnormal pattern in GC log
- Too many threads waiting for CPU


Memory usage monitoring: GC log

Application behaviour: Profiling
